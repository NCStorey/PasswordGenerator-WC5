## Description

This project was undertaken as part of the Trilogy Education skills bootcamp.

We were tasked with creating a password generator which would provide the user with a series of options (password length and character base), and then generate a randomised password based on their inputs.

In this technological world, a strong password is essential to protecting your data.

This project can be used by potential employers to show demonstration of my knowledge of functions, forloops and if statements.

It can also be used by others to see how I approaced the challenge.

## Tests

In the javascript file on line 206 there are some checks which I have commented out. Please uncomment these if you would like to see some of the infomation being stored/produced in the console log. I found these checks particularly useful when writing the code.
